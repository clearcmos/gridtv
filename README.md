Streamwall makes it easy to compose multiple livestreams into a mosaic, with source attributions and audio control.

This branch is a self-contained Twitch CCTV viewer built with Electron and
TypeScript. The video wall is the complete interface: there is no separate
local staging window.

## How it works

Under the hood, think of Streamwall as a specialized web browser for mosaicing video streams. It uses [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org) to create a grid of web browser views, loading the specified webpages into them. Once the page loads, Streamwall finds the `<video>` tag and reformats the page so that the video fills the space. This works for a wide variety of web pages without specialized scrapers.

![The Streamwall wall: a 3×3 mosaic of live German public-TV streams, each tile labeled with its source](docs/images/wall.jpg)

## Features

- **Exact 1–9 tile wall** — press **F1** and click a number; every count fills the window edge-to-edge without an unused grid cell.
- **Direct stream replacement** — click the edit/plus icon in any tile and type a Twitch username; a full URL is optional.
- **Per-tile audio mixing** — every tile can be muted or unmuted independently, so multiple streams can play audio simultaneously, each with its own volume slider.
- **Fast wall interaction** — double-click a playing tile to expand it, press Escape or double-click again to restore the wall, and drag one tile onto another to swap them.
- **Offline-aware restore** — saved Twitch assignments are checked together on startup; offline channels show a replaceable placeholder without creating a failing player.
- **Blur/censor** — blur individual tiles, or trigger a wall-wide [Streamdelay](https://github.com/chromakode/streamdelay) censor mode.
- **Dark mode** — light, dark, or system-matched theme in the control UI.
- **Remote control with roles** — an optional web-based control server lets operators run the wall from a browser, with **admin**, **operator**, and **monitor** roles gated by invite links.
- **Automatic recovery** — failed or stalled stream loads are retried automatically with exponential backoff, with the failure surfaced on the wall and in the control UI.
- **Flexible data sources** — load streams from JSON APIs, TOML files, or add them ad hoc (including `overlay`/`background` kinds for widgets and chroma-key layers).
- **Playlists** — optionally cycle a grid cell through a fixed list of stream URLs on an interval.
- **Twitch chat bot** — an optional bot posts templated announcements and runs viewer polls in a Twitch channel's chat.

The original control UI remains in the source tree for upstream compatibility,
but this desktop build does not launch it.

## Configuration

Streamwall has a growing number of configuration options. To get a summary run:

```
npm run start:app -- --help
```

For long-term installations, it's recommended to put your options into a
configuration file. Development runs use the root `start:app` script:

```
npm run start:app -- --config="../streamwall.toml"
```

Packaged app builds also auto-load `config.toml` from Electron's user data
directory before applying any `--config` file or CLI flags:

| OS      | Default user data config path                          |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| macOS   | `~/Library/Application Support/Streamwall/config.toml` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\\Streamwall\\config.toml`                   |
| Linux   | `~/.config/Streamwall/config.toml`                     |

Configuration precedence is:

1. user data `config.toml`
2. `--config` file
3. CLI flags

See `example.config.toml` for an example.

The wall works without a configuration file. Create `config.toml` at the path
above only when you want to override media quality, window placement, retry
behavior, or another advanced option.

### Logging

Streamwall writes logs to both the console and a file in Electron's userData
log directory (its exact path is printed to the console on startup). File
and console verbosity default to `debug`; set `log.level` in your config
file (see `example.config.toml`) or pass `--log.level=<level>` on the
command line to change it. Valid levels, from quietest to loudest: `error`,
`warn`, `info`, `verbose`, `debug`, `silly`.

### Media scaling

Stream views share one persistent browser session/cache by default. This avoids
downloading and retaining a separate copy of a site's application shell for
every tile and lets one operator login apply to all views from the same site.
Set `media.session-mode = "isolated"` for a unique ephemeral session per tile
when stronger browsing separation matters more than density.

Normal `https://twitch.tv/<channel>` inputs use Twitch's official lightweight
player page by default, avoiding a separate copy of Twitch navigation, chat,
and discovery UI in every tile. The default is `source`, Twitch's highest
available pass-through rendition (normally 1080p when the broadcaster offers
it, otherwise their highest source such as 720p). Set `media.twitch-quality`
to `160p`, `360p`, `480p`, `720p`, or `auto` when you prefer lower decoder and
bandwidth use. Set `media.twitch-player = false` to retain full Twitch channel
pages.

For a dense nine-tile CCTV wall, 160p players reduce bandwidth and decoder
pressure:

```toml
[grid]
cols = 3
rows = 3

[media]
twitch-quality = "160p"
```

On first launch, `grid.cols × grid.rows` supplies the initial tile count and is
clamped to the live wall's 1–9 range. After that, the F1 selection is persisted.
Available CPU/GPU video-decode capacity, memory, bandwidth, and Twitch
connection behavior still determine how many simultaneous videos work well.

Poster snapshots are bounded WebP images taken every 10 seconds, scaled no
larger than the visible tile or 640 pixels wide. Configure
`media.snapshot-interval`, `media.snapshot-max-width`, and
`media.snapshot-quality` in `example.config.toml`; an interval of `0` disables
snapshots. Stream views also load at their target tile dimensions, and direct
HLS inputs cap automatic quality selection to the player size.

### Wall hover controls

Hover a tile to pause/play it, adjust its volume, or toggle it between
**Muted** and **Unmuted**. Every unmuted tile is mixed simultaneously. The
wall does not place a permanent platform/name badge over a healthy video.

Double-click a playing tile to fill the wall. Double-click it again or press
**Escape** to return to the grid. Click and hold on a tile, then drag it onto
another tile to swap their positions; mute, volume, and playback settings move
with their streams.

Press **F1** to choose an exact tile count from 1 through 9. Shrinking keeps the
first active streams in visual order and closes every player that no longer
fits. The edit/plus icon in each tile opens the Twitch channel picker. Bare
usernames such as `lacy`, `@lacy`, and full channel URLs are all accepted.

Channel suggestions are requested only after 350 ms without another keystroke,
require at least two characters, return at most eight names, and are cached for
one minute. Search failure never prevents entering an exact username.

On every launch, assigned Twitch usernames are checked in one batched request
before players are created. A channel confirmed offline remains assigned and
is shown as **Offline**, where its edit button can replace it. If Twitch status
cannot be checked, the tile says **Status unavailable** and is also not loaded,
avoiding a misleading media/network failure.

Tile count, assignments, mute state, volume, and paused state are written while
the app runs. Pending writes are flushed before quit. Custom Twitch sources use
stable URL-derived IDs, so removing or reordering sources cannot detach the
saved layout on the next launch.

### Telemetry

Streamwall reports uncaught errors to a Sentry project run by the maintainers
(`telemetry.sentry`, default `true`). This covers the main process and every
renderer the app fully authors (the background and overlay layers); it
deliberately does **not** cover the per-stream views or
the "browse" window, since those load arbitrary third-party URLs and
attaching error reporting there would leak that content's context to Sentry.
To opt out, set `sentry = false` under `[telemetry]` in your config file (see
`example.config.toml`) or pass `--telemetry.sentry=false` on the command
line.

## Remote control server

For multi-operator setups, `streamwall-control-server` lets you control the
wall from a web browser instead of (or in addition to) the local "control"
webpage. Build the web client and start the server with:

```
npm run start:server
```

On first run it prints two links to the console:

```
🔌 Streamwall uplink (shown once — save it now): ws://localhost:3000/streamwall/<id>/ws?token=<secret>
🔑 Admin invite: http://localhost:3000/invite/<id>#token=<secret>
```

- **Uplink endpoint** connects this app to the server. Pass it via
  `--control.endpoint` on the command line, or set `endpoint` under
  `[control]` in your config file (see `example.config.toml`). The endpoint
  must use `wss://` (or `ws://` to a loopback host) — Streamwall refuses to
  connect over an insecure remote endpoint.
- **Admin invite** opens the web control client and signs you in as an admin.
  From there, admins can create invite links for the other roles.

Three roles are available: **admin** (full control, including managing
invites), **operator** (control the grid and streams), and **monitor**
(blur/censor only, read-only otherwise).

See
[`packages/streamwall-control-server/README.md`](packages/streamwall-control-server/README.md)
for environment variable configuration (hostname/port, storage location, rate
limits) and a production deployment walkthrough.

### Self-hosting behind your own domain

To control the wall from outside your local network — a phone, another
device on a different network — put `streamwall-control-server` behind a
domain with TLS. [`docs/self-hosting.md`](docs/self-hosting.md) walks
through the provided `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`
(`deploy/docker-compose.yml`), which wire the server together with a
[Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) reverse proxy for automatic Let's Encrypt
TLS:

```sh
cd deploy
cp .env.example .env   # set your domain, then see docs/self-hosting.md
docker compose up -d --build
```

**Known limitation:** grid edits (swap, drag-move, resize) sync as
independent per-cell updates in the shared Yjs document. If two operators
swap or move overlapping tiles at nearly the same instant, the last-writer-wins
merge can duplicate one stream into both tiles while dropping the other,
instead of leaving a consistent swap. This is inherent to modeling the grid as
independent per-cell values rather than one atomically-swapped unit, and is
low-impact in practice since concurrent operators rarely target the same
cells simultaneously.

## Data sources

Streamwall can load stream data from both JSON APIs and TOML files. Data sources can be specified in a config file (see `example.config.toml` for an example) or the command line:

```
npm run start:app -- --data.json-url="https://your-site/api/streams.json" --data.toml-file="./streams.toml"
```

Each entry (a `[[streams]]` table in TOML, or an object in the JSON array) supports the following fields. See `example.streams.toml` for examples.

| Field           | Type                                                                 | Required | Description                                                                                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `link`          | string                                                               | yes      | URL of the stream page. For `overlay` streams, this is the URL loaded in the overlay `<iframe>`. |
| `kind`          | `"video"` \| `"audio"` \| `"web"` \| `"background"` \| `"overlay"`   | no       | Defaults to `"video"`. See kind reference below.                                                 |
| `label`         | string                                                               | no       | Short title shown on the wall overlay.                                                           |
| `labelPosition` | `"top-left"` \| `"top-right"` \| `"bottom-right"` \| `"bottom-left"` | no       | Corner where the label is drawn. Defaults to `"top-left"`.                                       |
| `source`        | string                                                               | no       | Attribution shown on the wall when `label` is absent.                                            |
| `notes`         | string                                                               | no       | Free-text notes shown in the control UI (not on the wall overlay).                               |
| `status`        | string                                                               | no       | Free-text status shown in the control UI.                                                        |
| `city`          | string                                                               | no       | Shown under the stream label on the wall overlay.                                                |
| `state`         | string                                                               | no       | Shown alongside `city` on the wall overlay.                                                      |
| `orientation`   | `"V"` \| `"H"`                                                       | no       | Vertical or horizontal video orientation, used by the control UI.                                |
| `rotation`      | number (0–360)                                                       | no       | Degrees to rotate the loaded page, e.g. for phone streams held sideways.                         |
| `addedDate`     | string                                                               | no       | Free-text date, shown in the control UI.                                                         |

### `kind` reference

- `video` (default) — a normal livestream page; Streamwall finds the `<video>` tag and fills the tile with it.
- `audio` — like `video`, but the tile is treated as audio-only.
- `web` — an arbitrary webpage, shown as-is without searching for a `<video>` tag.
- `background` — a webpage loaded behind the grid instead of in a tile.
- `overlay` — a webpage loaded as a full-screen `<iframe>` layered over the whole wall (e.g. scoreboards, alerts). See [Security: overlay and background streams](#security-overlay-and-background-streams) below.

## Playlists

A grid cell can optionally cycle through a fixed list of stream URLs on an
interval, independent of manual placement or any data source. Add one
`[[playlist]]` table per cell you want to cycle (see `example.config.toml`):

```toml
[[playlist]]
view = 0
interval = 60
urls = ["https://example.com/stream-a", "https://example.com/stream-b"]
```

| Field      | Type     | Required | Description                                                             |
| ---------- | -------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `view`     | number   | yes      | The grid cell (0-indexed) to cycle. Must be within the configured grid. |
| `interval` | number   | yes      | Seconds between advances.                                               |
| `urls`     | string[] | yes      | Stream URLs to cycle through, in order, looping back to the start.      |

A cell without a matching `[[playlist]]` table behaves as usual — assign it
manually from the control UI. Each URL is matched against the streams
currently known from your data sources (`json-url`/`toml-file`/custom); if a
URL doesn't currently resolve to a known stream, that step is skipped with a
warning and the cell keeps its previous content until the next advance.

## Security: overlay and background streams

Streams added with the `overlay` or `background` kind are loaded as live web
pages layered over the whole wall, inside sandboxed `<iframe>`s. Anyone with
control access can point these tiles at an arbitrary URL, so treat their
contents as untrusted.

These frames run with `sandbox="allow-scripts"` only. Scripts are allowed so
widget-style overlays (scoreboards, alerts, players) still work, but the page
runs in an opaque origin: it cannot escape its sandbox, reach Streamwall's
internal APIs, or read the app's cookies and storage. Top-level navigation,
popups, forms and downloads stay blocked.

`allow-same-origin` is intentionally not granted — combined with `allow-scripts`
it would let a page remove its own sandbox attribute and defeat the protection.
As a result, overlay/background pages have no access to their own origin's
cookies or local storage; widgets that depend on same-origin persistence are not
supported by design.

## Hotkeys

The following hotkeys are available with a "control" webpage focused, whether
that's the Electron control UI or the standalone web control client:

- **alt+[1...9,0,q,w,e,r,t,y,u,i,o,p]**: Listen to the corresponding stream
  (grid positions 0-19, in that key order)
- **alt+ctrl+[1...9,0,q,w,e,r,t,y,u,i,o,p]**: Listen to the corresponding
  stream (grid positions 20-39, same key order, for grids larger than 20 cells)
- **alt+shift+[1...9,0,q,w,e,r,t,y,u,i,o,p]**: Toggle blur on the
  corresponding stream (grid positions 0-19, in that key order)
- **alt+ctrl+shift+[1...9,0,q,w,e,r,t,y,u,i,o,p]**: Toggle blur on the
  corresponding stream (grid positions 20-39, same key order, for grids larger
  than 20 cells)
- **alt+s**: Select the currently focused stream box to be swapped
- **alt+c**: Activate [Streamdelay](https://github.com/chromakode/streamdelay) censor mode
- **alt+shift+c**: Deactivate [Streamdelay](https://github.com/chromakode/streamdelay) censor mode

The overlay window has its own hotkey:

- **ctrl+shift+i**: Open devtools for the overlay

## Building & releasing the desktop app

`npm run package` / `npm run make` / `npm run publish` (in
`packages/streamwall`) build the Electron app with
[Electron Forge](https://www.electronforge.io/). By default these produce
**unsigned** binaries — fine for local development, but macOS and Windows
both warn or outright block unsigned apps for end users, and Electron's
auto-updater requires a signed app on macOS.

To produce signed, notarized builds, set these environment variables before
running `make`/`publish` (see `packages/streamwall/forge.signing.ts`):

| Variable                       | Purpose                                                           |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID`                | Apple Developer Team ID                                           |
| `APPLE_API_KEY`                | Path to an App Store Connect API key (`.p8`) used by `notarytool` |
| `APPLE_API_KEY_ID`             | App Store Connect API Key ID                                      |
| `APPLE_API_ISSUER`             | App Store Connect API Issuer ID                                   |
| `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_FILE`     | Path to a Windows code-signing certificate (`.pfx`)               |
| `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | Password for the certificate above                                |

macOS signing additionally requires a Developer ID Application certificate to
already be present in the signing machine's keychain (e.g. imported via
[`apple-actions/import-codesign-certs`](https://github.com/Apple-Actions/import-codesign-certs-action)
in CI). The macOS and Windows variables are independent — set either, both,
or neither. Builds with none of these set are unsigned, exactly as before.

**Until a release is signed:** macOS quarantines downloaded, unsigned apps
and may refuse to open them ("Streamwall is damaged and can't be opened").
Users can work around this by removing the quarantine attribute after
downloading:

```sh
xattr -cr /Applications/Streamwall.app
```

or by right-clicking the app and choosing "Open" instead of double-clicking.

### CI releases

Pushing a `v*` tag (or running the workflow manually) triggers
`.github/workflows/release.yml`, which runs the quality gate (lint, typecheck,
test) and then builds and publishes a GitHub release for Linux, Windows, and
macOS via `electron-forge publish`. Signing in CI is opt-in, matching the
local `make`/`publish` behavior above: builds stay unsigned until these
repository secrets are set.

| Secret                         | Purpose                                                       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_P12`        | Developer ID Application certificate (`.p12`), base64-encoded |
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`   | Password for the certificate above                            |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID`                | Apple Developer Team ID                                       |
| `APPLE_API_KEY_BASE64`         | App Store Connect API key (`.p8`), base64-encoded             |
| `APPLE_API_KEY_ID`             | App Store Connect API Key ID                                  |
| `APPLE_API_ISSUER`             | App Store Connect API Issuer ID                               |
| `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_BASE64`   | Windows code-signing certificate (`.pfx`), base64-encoded     |
| `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | Password for the certificate above                            |

The workflow imports the macOS certificate into the runner's keychain via
`apple-actions/import-codesign-certs`, decodes the base64 secrets into
temporary files for the Windows certificate and the Apple API key, and sets
