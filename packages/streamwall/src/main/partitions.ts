/**
 * Session partition helpers for isolating web content.
 *
 * Streamwall loads arbitrary third-party sites as stream views and lets the
 * operator open a browse window. Electron sessions are keyed by their
 * `partition` string: contexts that share a partition also share cookies,
 * localStorage and cache. A partition name beginning with `persist:` is written
 * to disk and survives across app restarts; any other name lives only in memory
 * and is discarded when its last web context goes away.
 *
 * To prevent cross-site data bleed and persistent tracking, every stream view
 * gets its own unique, ephemeral partition and the browse window gets a separate
 * ephemeral partition of its own.
 *
 * @see https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/session
